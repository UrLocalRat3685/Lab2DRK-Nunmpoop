## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice numeric data analysis using Python and the NumPy module with a real-world dataset. Using NBA player statistics by season, this project focuses on analyzing player performance across different seasons by calculating shooting accuracy, scoring efficiency, and defensive metrics. This assignment helped strengthen my understanding of NumPy ndarrays and how they can be used to perform efficient, vectorized data analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv`, which contains detailed NBA player statistics by season, including games played, minutes, points, shooting data, and defensive statistics. For this analysis, only NBA regular season data was used to keep the results consistent and relevant.

## Project Design and Implementation
Alright, so first we start this project by following a clear step-by-step workflow. First, we load the CSV file using Python’s `csv.DictReader` to safely handle real-world formatting. We then convert the necessary columns into NumPy ndarrays to allow for numerical operations! So, after filtering the dataset to include only NBA regular season records, several performance metrics are calculated using NumPy’s vectorized operations. Finally, the results are exported to CSV files for further analysis and review :)

## Metrics Calculated
For each player in each season, the following metrics were calculated:

- **Field Goal Accuracy:** FGM / FGA  
- **Three Point Accuracy:** 3PM / 3PA  
- **Free Throw Accuracy:** FTM / FTA  
- **Points Per Minute:** PTS / MIN  
- **Overall Shooting Accuracy:** (FGM + FTM) / (FGA + FTA)  
- **Blocks Per Game:** BLK / GP  
- **Steals Per Game:** STL / GP  

All calculations are performed using NumPy! (with safeguards in place to prevent division-by-zero errors ^_^ )

## Output Files
The following output files are generated by the program:

- `metrics_by_player_season.csv` — contains all calculated metrics for each player-season.
- `top100_fg_accuracy.csv`
- `top100_3p_accuracy.csv`
- `top100_ft_accuracy.csv`
- `top100_pts_per_min.csv`
- `top100_overall_accuracy.csv`
- `top100_blk_per_game.csv`
- `top100_stl_per_game.csv`

Each Top 100 file ranks player-seasons from highest to lowest based on the selected metric.

## Limitations
This analysis does have a few limitations. Overall shooting accuracy is defined using a simple formula and does not include advanced efficiency metrics such as true shooting percentage and also, no minimum attempt or game thresholds were applied, which means some players with limited playing time may appear in the rankings. Each player/season is treated independently, without combining data across multiple seasons.

## Generative AI Usage
I used ChatGPT to help debug and find errors that I was getting stuck on! All code was reviewed, tested, and executed by me :)
